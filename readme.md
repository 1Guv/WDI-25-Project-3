## Approach Taken
- This app was our first group project at GA, because of this the planning phase was crucial in order to ensure all members had a clear idea as to what the final product should be.
- After a long discussion where all group members were welcome to put forth their ideas, we decided on a skills Sharing app.
- From there we planned our page layout and user journey through balsamic as a group.
- We continued to work as a group throughout the project using an agile approach which included morning stand-ups.
- We also used Git to manage version control

## Features
- A user can search the user database by language/name and distance from current location
- Once a user has a fully completed profile, the user can message other users through nodeMailer. This ensures that personal emails do not need to be posted on the site.
- A user can add skills to the database. If they do not already exist.
- Page is fully responsive
