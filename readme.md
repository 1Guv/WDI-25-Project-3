# SpeakEasy - Meet up. Speak up. Language exchange...

######GA WDI-25 London - Project 3:

Our idea encompasses the current meetup phenomenon where it allows two individuals to meet and share a skill, eg if i wanted to improve my French I could use this app to find a native French speaker and offer to share a skill in return. Once registered, and then logged in, they can search for a skill and see the profiles of those users on a map. The map will show how far others are from your current location and you can also filter by distance.

The user can login via Facebook or GitHub and you are only able to contact another user once you have fully registered eg filled out a full profile with a skill to share. Otherwise there will be a message asking the user to register. Once registered each user profile and messaging becomes unlocked so the current logged in fully registered user has full access to use the site.
